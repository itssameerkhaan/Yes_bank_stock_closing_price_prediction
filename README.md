# Yes_bank_stock_closing_price_prediction

In this project, we aim to predict the closing price of Yes Bank's stock using historical financial data and machine learning techniques. The closing price of a stock is an essential indicator for investors and traders to make informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or holding the stock.

The primary objective of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the closing price of Yes Bank's stock based on the available historical data.
he model will help investors and traders make more informed decisions and potentially improve their trading strategies.

probjems :-
1. Data Collection: Gather historical financial data for Yes Bank from reliable sources, such as financial websites or APIs.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering to extract relevant features for the regression model.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of the target variable (closing price) and explore relationships between features and the target variable.
4. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that have a significant impact on the closing price using correlation analysis and feature importance techniques.
5. Model Selection: Experiment with different regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression, to determine the best-performing model.
6. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model on the training data and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques to optimize model performance.
7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess how well the model predicts the closing price.
8. Result Interpretation: Interpret the model's predictions and provide insights into the factors influencing the closing price of Yes Bank's stock.
